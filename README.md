# Terraria Pre-Alpha Decompilation
---
a decompilation of the 2011 pre alpha of terraria.
<br>/
this is nothing like the final game and should not be used as an alternative to piracy.
## todo:
---
- [x] - monogame port
###### - literally just imported the package, didnt know it was that easy
- [x] - get running 
- [ ] - format code / overall better looking code
###### - for example, there's various bits of code that look off, like variables named "num", and "flag". ik this is from the decompiler but i still would like to clean it up.
- [ ] -  finish
###### - ill figure more out when i get there
---
###### idk how to write decent markdown so it probably looks like shit
